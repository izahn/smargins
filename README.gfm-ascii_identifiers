## Overview

`smargins` is a package that aids in calculating Average Marginal
Effects for models of various kinds. There are many packages like it
(e.g., [coreSim](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/coreSim/),
[effects](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/effects/),
[lsmeans](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/lsmeans/),
[margins](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/margins/),
[rms](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/rms/) and
[Zelig](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/Zelig/)) but this one is
mine.

The main functions provided by this package are: \* `smargins()`
calculates average marginal effects \* `scompare()` performs pairwise
comparisons of the average marginal effects produced by `smargins`.

Some examples are available at (<https://izahn.github.io/smargins/>)

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this package is to serve as a test bed for
exploring interfaces and designs for R packages that facilitate
calculating quantities of interest. Several such packages exist, each
with their own pros and cons. This package is serves as a play ground
where we can try different approaches in order to see if we can find one
with more pros and fewer cons than existing solutions.

## Installation

`smargins` is not on CRAN (and may never be). You can install it from
github using the `devtools` package:

## Usage

``` r
library(smargins)

mtcars <- transform(mtcars, gear = factor(gear))

m.sm <- smargins(lm(mpg ~ gear, data = mtcars),
                 gear = levels(gear))
summary(m.sm)
#>   gear     mean       sd   median lower_2.5 upper_97.5
#> 1    3 16.07768 1.232141 16.06126  13.64931   18.53487
#> 2    4 24.51305 1.346233 24.53086  21.84483   27.13678
#> 3    5 21.36735 2.128667 21.34528  17.22526   25.52806

summary(scompare(m.sm, "gear"))
#>     gear      mean       sd    median  lower_2.5 upper_97.5
#> 1 3 vs 4 -8.435368 1.834999 -8.428222 -12.014409 -4.7772074
